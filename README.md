# Basic Azur Lane data viewer

Welcome to my side project of Django and SQL for my favorite game, Azur Lane!
Feel free to look around and make suggestion since this is my first Django project.

# Instructions

* Then proceed with running the server via **python manage.py runserver**
* View the page via **localhost:port/display**

# Prerequisite
* Install the required assets via **pip install -r requirements.txt**

# Special thanks to
